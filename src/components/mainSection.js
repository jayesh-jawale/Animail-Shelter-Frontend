              We all love animals, don't we? Animal shelters have played a vital
              role in helping out our friends in distress. The next time you see
              any animal injured, abused or neglected, feel free to contact
              animal shelters.

              Our rescues, admissions, and treatment get listed on our Social
              media pages on a DAILY BASIS. From 2018 end, we provided FREE
              treatment to almost 8000 admitted dogs till now. From 2021 we
              started admitting birds, mainly because there was a huge scarcity
              of aviary in Pune and many city birds lost their lives.

              Yes, you heard it right! We are probably the only facility in Pune
              which is entirely cage-free. We built almost 60ft√ó25 ft airy
              kennels where similar natured animals are kept together. They get
              their freedom too which reduces the stress of being sick & not in
              their territory considerably.
